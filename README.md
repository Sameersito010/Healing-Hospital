## 🏥 Healing Hospitals: SQL-Powered Patient Analytics

Welcome to **Healing Hospitals**, a data analytics project that uses the power of **SQL** to decode patient trends, optimize hospital operations, and deliver smarter, data-driven healthcare.

### 📌 Project Overview

In this project, we used SQL to transform raw hospital data into meaningful insights, answering real-world healthcare questions such as:

* 🧍‍♂️ **How many patients were treated across all hospitals?**
* 👨‍⚕️ **Which departments have the highest patient load?**
* 💰 **Which hospital had the highest medical expenses?**
* 📅 **How long do patients typically stay in each department?**
* 🌍 **Which cities serve the most patients?**

This project demonstrates how **structured queries can heal operational blind spots** in healthcare systems.


### 🧠 Skills & Concepts Used

* `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT INTO`, `SELECT`
* `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
* Date difference calculations using `TO_DATE()`


### 🔍 Analytical Highlights

| 🔢 Query | 📊 Objective                               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1        | Total number of patients                   |
| 3        | Top 3 departments with the most patients   |
| 4        | Hospital with the highest medical expenses |
| 6        | Longest hospital stay                      |
| 8        | Average stay duration per department       |
| 10       | Monthly medical expenses summary           |
